## Projects
### Mobile Video Search System
![Image text](http://liuwu.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/2/1/22218328/3494847.jpg?510)
* I develop an instant mobile video search system through which users can discover videos by simply pointing their phones at a screen to capture a few seconds of what they are watching. The main contributions of this work: 1) Design an innovative mobile video system which represents one of the first attempts towards instant and progressive video search leveraging the light-weight computing capacity of mobile devices. 2) Propose a new layered audio-video (LAVE) indexing scheme to holistically exploit the mutual complementarity between audio and video signals for more robust mobile video search. 3) Propose a progressive query process to support varying length of the query video, where in most cases the length is much less than those in any existing mobile applications. This significantly reduces query time and thus improves user's search experience. The work has been accepted by ACM MM 2013 as full paper and demo paper, IEEE Trans. on Multimedia 2014
### Estimating Human Body Orientation based on RGB-D Sensors

* I propose an innovative RGB-D based orientation estimation method to estimate the human body orientation. By utilizing the RGB-D information, the proposed method is robust to complicated environment. Specifically, efficient static and motion cue extraction methods are proposed based on the RGB-D superpixels to reduce the noise of depth data. Furthermore, we propose to use a Dynamic Bayesian Network System (DBNS) to effectively employ the complementary nature of both static and motion cues. The work has been accepted by IEEE Trans. on SMC-B.
### RGB-D based People Search in Intelligent Visual Surveillance
![Image text](http://liuwu.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/2/1/22218328/__8120046.png)
* I propose a novel RGB-D based IVS system which is capable of handling multi-attribute queries for searching people in surveillance videos. Taking the advantages of RGB-D information in human segmentation and 3D scene establishment, three groups of human attributes are extracted, i.e., biometrical attributes, appearance attributes and motion attributes. Furthermore, a novel IVS system with RGB-D camera is established, which provides an effective way of searching people via multi-attribute query, following the natural way of finding people in real-world. The work has been published in MMM 2012.
